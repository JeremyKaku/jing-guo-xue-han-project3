# Password Manager App

Overview
As more and more companies experience hacks and cybersecurity becomes more important, there are many services that can generate and manage passwords on your behalf. For this assignment, you will make a simple service that allows you to track and generate passwords on your behalf. You will also be able to share passwords with other people if you choose.

One note of caution: you may be familiar with programs like LastPass or similar that integrate as an add-on to your browser and have features such as auto-inserting or auto-logging in. I am NOT expecting this kind of functionality. For your project, you can assume users will simply copy and paste passwords as necessary.

For this assignment, you may work with up to two additional students, to make a group of 3. You can also tackle this work by yourself as well.

Please note: you are welcome to come up with your own project idea, but you must contact the teaching staff at least a week before the assignment is due to ensure that the code is sufficiently worthwhile and can reasonably meet the expectations of the rubric below. I am also open to you experimenting with other technologies in your stack, but again, please see me first. The requests must be submitted before the final class.

Finally, I recommend you use the code I provide in class as a basis for this project as much of the frustrating setup is handled there.
